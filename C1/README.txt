At the moment, the project supports all requirements outlined in Milestone 1. 
To build the project simply go through the 3 files in C2. 

The first will create the Schema and the tables with all constraints.
The second will populate the database with sample data.
The third will create the stored procedures that are still being worked on, but can be tested.

In C5, the project in its entirety can be viewed.
